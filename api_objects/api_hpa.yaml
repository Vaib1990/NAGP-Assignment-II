# This HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) configuration automatically adjusts the number of pods in the
# 'api-service' deployment based on CPU utilization. The HPA ensures that the number of replicas
# remains between a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6. The target is to maintain the average CPU
# utilization at 20%. This setup helps in optimizing resource usage and maintaining performance
# under varying loads by scaling the number of pods up or down as needed.
